“SOLauncher”: A RPC over HTTP tool for remote process execution

There are different scenarios in a computer system where the use of remote machines rather than local ones is suitable: this in fact increases the scalability of the system, the accessibility and centralization of resources, and even the security of the use context. 
As a result, the need often arises to automatically or supervisedly execute processes hosted on remote machines, based on specific situations. Usually, to perform tasks of this type, it is necessary to connect using “remote desktop”, possess specific execution or folder access permissions, or foresee folder sharing on the network. This involves various disadvantages, including the use of bandwidth (sometimes limited for reasons of geographic reach or otherwise), the loss of security, and poor control over the outcome of the operations performed, just to mention a few.
Unless special custom solutions are created, these operations must be performed by monitoring the machine, and for competence and/or security reasons they are almost always entrusted to users with special system profile skills, often domain administrators.
SOLauncher has been designed to allow third-party users, perhaps lacking in specific knowledge and/or permissions, to perform complex operations in a simplified/secure context such as a web interface.
